// Question: Define an abstract class Shape with abstract methods area() and perimeter(),
//           and a concrete draw() that prints the class name.
// Create classes Circle, Rectangle, Triangle that extend Shape and implement area() and perimeter().
// In main(), instantiate each shape with sample dimensions and add them to a List<Shape>.
// Loop through your List<Shape> and for each shape, print its area, perimeter, and call draw().
